# Battleship

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) javascript curriculum.

In this project I've build the classic board game Battleships. Leading up to the project I've learned
about Javascript test (using jest), and how it can be of great use. Writing test for your code can save
you time and ensures that your code is behaving the way you expect it to.
